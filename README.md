Optimize Signal Timing using Traffic Density and Pattern Analysis

## Project Summary

A data-driven traffic management project designed to optimize signal timings at intersections. The system analyzes traffic density to dynamically adjust signal phases, aiming to reduce congestion and vehicle waiting time.

## Key Objectives

* Improve traffic flow efficiency
* Reduce average waiting time
* Demonstrate intelligent traffic signal control using data

## Technologies

Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Key Features

* Dynamic signal timing based on traffic density
* Traffic pattern analysis and visualization
* Comparison with fixed-time signal logic

## Execution

Run the Jupyter Notebook cells sequentially to view analysis and results.

## Future Enhancements

Real-time traffic data integration, reinforcement learning–based control, and multi-intersection optimization.
